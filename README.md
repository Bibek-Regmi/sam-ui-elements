Developers should work in the `main` branch. We're not using `develop` or `master` since this repo is meant to be a submodule and doesn't need to be deployed with the pipeline.

# Contributing
Create a feature branch from the latest `main` branch code. After development is finished, submit a PR with `main` as the target.
